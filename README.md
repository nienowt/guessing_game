Description
-----------
Runs a guessing game in which the user is prompted to answer a series of questions
about the author.  The number of correct answers is tallied and ultimately returned
to the user following completion of the game.


Levity
------
Q: What did the green grape say to the purple grape?



A: "Breathe, you idiot!"


Co-working
----------
Dan & Thom put all the questions into functions and added functionality to write answers to the HTML instead of alerts.
